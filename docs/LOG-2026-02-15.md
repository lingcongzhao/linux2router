● The fix is complete. Here's a summary of what was changed:                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Root cause: hx-boost="true" on <body> prevents inline <script> tags from executing when pages are loaded via AJAX navigation.
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Solution: Moved all confirmation modal functions to /static/js/app.js (loaded in <head>, always available) and updated the setPolicy calls to use a new signature with baseUrl as the
  first parameter.                                                                                                                                                                      
   
  Changes made:                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                            
  1. app.js - Added/updated global functions:
    - setPolicy(baseUrl, table, chain, policy, selectEl) - new signature
    - showDeleteTableModal(name) - for routing table deletion
    - refreshTableSelect() - for refreshing table dropdowns
  2. Updated setPolicy calls in:
    - firewall.html (inline chains)
    - firewall_table.html (partial)
    - netns_firewall_table.html (partial)
  3. Removed redundant inline scripts from 10 pages:
    - firewall.html, netns_firewall.html, routes.html, ipset.html, ipset_detail.html, netns_routes.html, rules.html, netns_rules.html, interfaces.html, interface_detail.html

  The Set Policy dropdown confirmation modal should now work on first page visit without requiring a page refresh.
